  <p>Hi there! My name is Katie Soldau and I will graduate in May 2016 with a combined degree in Computer Science and Interactive Media from Northeastern University. My focus has been on front-end engineering, but I am also interested in design and UX. I believe in the importance of design.</p>
  <p>Right now I am working with a team of designers and web developers at <a target="_blank" href="http://northeastern.edu/scout">Scout</a>, a student-run studio at Northeastern's College of Arts, Media and Design. I am also currently creating an interactive installation for my senior capstone project.
  </p>
  <p>In my spare time I enjoy trying to get around on my penny board, scavenger hunts (I once placed first in an intense 24-hour one), spending time in the woods, spending time in new cities, and learning a little bit (or more than a little bit) about a lot of things. This semester, I am researching the ethics of space exploration with a professor at my university and am on a mission to finally become fluent in Spanish.
  </p>
